# Introduction
Statistical analysis is vital in data science and machine learning for deriving insights, making predictions, and guiding decision-making. This session covers basic statistical methods using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scipy, and datasets from sklearn, Kaggle, and UCI.

# Section 1: Basic Concepts in Statistics

**1.1 Population and Sample**
- **Population**: Entire set of observations (e.g., all adults in a city).
- **Sample**: Subset of the population (e.g., 500 randomly selected adults).

**1.2 Need for Sampling**
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the cost of data collection.
- **Time Efficiency**: Provides quicker insights.
- **Feasibility**: Often impractical to study an entire population.
- **Manageability**: Simplifies data analysis.

**1.3 Benefits of Sampling**
- **Accuracy**: Proper sampling reflects the population accurately.
- **Less Data Overhead**: Easier to handle and analyze.
- **Focused Research**: Allows for detailed analysis of specific aspects.

# Section 2: Understanding Basic Statistical Methods

**2.1 Descriptive Statistics**
- **Mean**: Average of data; sensitive to outliers.
- **Median**: Middle value; robust against outliers.
- **Mode**: Most frequent value; useful for categorical data.
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: Measure of variation; square root of variance.
- **Variance**: Average of squared differences from the mean.
- **Range**: Difference between max and min values; sensitive to outliers.

**Additional Descriptive Measures**
- **Percentiles and Quartiles**: Divide data into segments; indicate distribution.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Range of middle 50% of data; robust measure of spread.
- **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry of distribution.
- **Kurtosis**: Measures the “tailedness” or extremity of distribution.

**2.2 Inferential Statistics**
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluates hypotheses about population parameters.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Range likely containing the true population parameter.
- **Regression Analysis**: Models relationship between variables; predicts outcomes.
- **ANOVA**: Compares means of multiple groups.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Tests independence of categorical variables.

Inferential statistics help in making predictions and drawing conclusions beyond the immediate data.
